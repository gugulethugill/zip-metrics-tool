# **Zip Metrics Tool**

This tool takes an input ZIP file as a parameter and collects various metrics (like size, modified date, word count, median word size and etc) for the text files within this folder. The tool then generates an output file in Excel format, including metrics for individual files as well as a summary for the entire directory.

### Results
The Excel File is being downloaded to the working directory of the project with the metrics.
